          uses the Discontinuous Petrov Galerkin (DPG) method to solve
          a Poisson problem, and repeatedly refines the mesh, guided by

          compared, one of which refines cells which represent a fixed percentage
          of the error (case 0), and one of which refines a fixed percentage 
          of the cells (case1).  The problem uses a discontinuous diffusivity 
          function kappa(x,y).

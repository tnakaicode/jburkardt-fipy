  FENICS/Python version
  p-Laplacian investigation
  Generate the right hand side function f(x,y)
  for a Poisson problem
  - div kappa(u,x,y) grad u = f(x,y) in Omega
                          u = g(x,y) on dOmega
  where we have already chosen
    u(x,y) = 1 + x + 2y
    kappa(u,x,y) = 1 + u^2
  and want f(x,y) computed symbolically by SymPy.

  Formula for F(x,y) computed by SymPy:

  f(x,y) =  -10*x[0] - 20*x[1] - 10

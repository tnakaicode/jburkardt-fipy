      MITCHELL_FENICS <br> Mitchell Elliptic Test Problems for FENICS
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>MITCHELL_FENICS</b>,
      example scripts which
      set up and solve Mitchell's 2D Elliptic Partial Differential Equations 
      (PDE's) using the FENICS package.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mitchell proposed these problems as a test suite for adaptive PDE solvers.
      An adaptive solver is one that constructs a proposed solution, estimates
      the error in this proposed solution, and then modifies its approach,
      perhaps by refining the mesh or using higher order elements, to reduce
      the error.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this directory, we simply attempt to set up a fixed mesh and finite
      element space and solve the problem once.

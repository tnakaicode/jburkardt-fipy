    <p>
      <b>GLACIER</b>
      is a FENICS script which
      defines the steady 2D Stokes equations for a model of the motion of
      ice in a glacier, by William Mitchell.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since this example was published, FENICS has changed, and several 
      commands used in the example no longer work.  This seems to happen
      A LOT.
